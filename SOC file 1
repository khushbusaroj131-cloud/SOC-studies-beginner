A complete Open-Source SOC (Security Operations Center) 
Lab built using community-driven tools. This project integrates Wazuh, Graylog, MISP, Cortex, TheHive, Velociraptor, and n8n to provide a real-world 
SOC experience with log analysis, threat hunting, DFIR, automation, and incident management.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

Build an open-source SOC stack with:
Wazuh, Graylog, MISP, Cortex, TheHive, Velociraptor, n8n

Collect logs from Windows, Linux, Cloud, and Syslog devices

Perform log analysis, correlation, and dashboarding

Use MISP for threat intelligence & IOC enrichment

Practice DFIR & Threat Hunting with Velociraptor

Automate SOC workflows using n8n
